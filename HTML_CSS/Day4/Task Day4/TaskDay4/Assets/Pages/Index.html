                <p>
                    Petra is a unique example of the oldest Arab civilization (the Nabataean civilization), as the Nabataean Arabs carved it from the rock more than 2000 years ago, and it is a witness to the most rich and creative ancient Arab civilizations, as the site of Petra remained undiscovered to the West throughout the Ottoman period, until it was rediscovered by the Swiss orientalist Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1812, through an expedition in the Levant, Egypt and Arabia for the British Royal Geographical Society, so many scholars and orientalists call Petra “the lost city” due to the delay in showing it to the world, and the English poet Bergen described it as the eastern city The stunning, pink city like no other.

                <h2>The longest Roman Tunnel In The World</h2>
                <p>
                    The first tunnels in the Mediterranean were built to transport water from distant springs and mountains to arid areas and cities. They also ensured the constant supply of water when cities were under siege. For example, the 533 m (583 yards) Hezekiah tunnel built in the late 8th and early 7th century BCE took water from the Gihon spring to the city of Jerusalem and was built as the city was preparing for an impending siege by the Assyrians. The Romans adopted the construction techniques of other civilizations to build a large number of tunnels in the territories that they controlled in Europe, North Africa and Asia Minor. They built tunnels to transport water, to divert rivers, to drain lakes for the irrigation of agricultural lands, and for their road projects and mining operations.

                <p>
                    This area characterized by the abundance of wild plants that grow on the banks of the valley, due to the location of this site on the western side of Wadi Zarqa, near a water spring called “L’in Ghazal” and next to this spring the village is located (Karasna 1989: 34). Ain Ghazal is an agricultural village that dates back to the eighth millennium BC.
